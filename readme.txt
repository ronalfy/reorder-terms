A simple and easy way to reorder your terms in WordPress.

== Description ==

We consider Reorder Terms a <strong>developer tool</strong>. If you do not know what `menu_order` or custom queries are, then this plugin is likely not for you.  This is an add-on to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/metronet-reorder-posts/">Reorder Posts</a> and requires <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/metronet-reorder-posts/">Reorder Posts 2.1.0 or greater</a>.

Reorder Terms takes a different approach to term reordering. Instead of modifying core tables to achieve reordering, we do it using term meta per post type.

With the ability to add taxonomies to multiple post types, this method allows you to reorder terms within each post type attached to the same taxonomy.

This plugin treats terms like pages. Each term in a hierarchy has a term order. This allows quick reordering and deep traversing to get the exact terms and order you prefer.

As a result, you can get reordered terms with a query such as:

`
$query = array(
    'orderby' => 'meta_value_num',
    'order' => 'ASC',
    'meta_query' => array(
        'relation' => 'OR',
        array(
            'key' => 'post_order',
            'compare' => 'NOT EXISTS'
        ),
        array(
            'key' => 'post_order',
            'value' => 0,
            'compare' => '>='
        )
    ),
    'hide_empty' => true,
    'parent' => 0
);
$terms = get_terms( 'post_format', $query );
echo '<ul>';
foreach( $terms as $term ) {
	printf( '<li>%s</li>', esc_html( $term->name ) );
}
echo '</ul>';
`

While admittedly the query isn't exactly poetry, it's efficient, and insanely flexible.
